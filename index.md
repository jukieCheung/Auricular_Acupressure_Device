## Getting Started
1. Set the pressure knob’s white marker to **horizontal (minimum)**.
2. Put on the automatic pressure unit to cover the auricle; wear the ear cover on the other side.
3. Adjust headband length if needed.

## Donning & Doffing
- Donning: knob to **minimum** → wear device on ear → fix with ear cover.  
- Doffing: turn knob back to **minimum**, then remove.

## Pressure
- Horizontal = **minimum**. Turn clockwise to **increase**. Start low and ramp up gradually.

## Power & LEDs
- On battery while operating: **blue solid**; **blue blinking** = low battery.  
- USB-C plugged while off: **red** = charging; **green** = full.  
- Use while charging: **magenta**; full & charging: **cyan**; low & charging: **magenta blinking**.

## Battery Isolation
- Isolation key disconnects the battery. With USB-C: **green with red hue** indicates isolation.  
- If isolation is pressed, device won’t run even if some lights blink. If it won’t press, the battery may need replacement.

## Charging
- Charge via **USB-C**. Red → charging; Green → full.

## FAQ
- Shuts off quickly: charge first.  
- Discomfort at first use: start at **minimum**.  
- No operation: check **isolation key** or battery status.
