## General Description
The Auricular Acupressure Device (AAD) provides targeted acupressure therapy. The device consists of a headband that connects an automatic acupressure unit and an ear cover on the other side (Fig. 1). The automatic acupressure unit features movable pressure heads to stimulate the acupoints (Fig. 2). The locations of the user controls are demonstrated in Fig. 3.

## Donning & Doffing

**Donning:**  
Adjust the white indicating bar on the Pressure Adjustment Knob (1) to a horizontal position to minimize acupressure before donning, ensuring comfortable use.  
Wear the AAD on your head so that the ear mould of the Automatic Acupressure Unit fits properly over your ear shell. Then, position the Ear Cover over the ear on the other side (Fig. 4).

**Doffing:**  
Similarly, turn the white indicating bar of the Pressure Adjustment Knob (1) to a horizontal position to minimize the acupressure before doffing (removing) the device.  

*For more details regarding pressure adjustment, please refer to the Pressure Adjustment section below.*

## Adjustment to Fit Individual Head Size
The size of the AAD can be adjusted to fit your head by extending or retracting the Length Adjustment arms (4) located on the headband.

---

## Turning On & Off
To power the AAD on or off, press the On/Off Button (5).  
The device can operate using its built-in battery or by connecting an external power source to the USB-C input port (6).

---

## Battery Light (Power Indicator)
When the AAD is operating on its built-in battery, the Battery Light (Power Indicator) (2) will show a solid blue color.  
If the blue light starts flashing after the AAD is turned on, it means the battery needs to be charged. To recharge the battery, connect an external power source to the USB-C input port. If the battery level becomes extremely low, the blue Power Indicator may turn off, and the AAD may stop functioning at any time. If the blue light flashes after switching on the AAD, please stop using the device and charge the battery.

When the device is connected to an external power source via the USB-C connector and powered off, the Power Indicator will be **red** to indicate charging, and **green** when the battery is fully charged. Please disconnect the USB-C power source when the green light is on.  
If the device is operating while connected to the USB-C power source and charging, the Power Indicator will display in **magenta**.  
When the AAD is in use and connected to USB-C power with a fully charged battery, the Power Indicator will show **cyan**.  
If the battery is low while the device is operating and charging, the **magenta** Power Indicator will flash.

## Pressure Adjustment
The acupressure intensity of the AAD can be adjusted using the Pressure Adjustment Knob (1). When the white indicating bar on the knob is in a horizontal position, the acupressure is set to the minimal level, as shown in Figure 5. To increase the pressure, simply turn the Pressure Adjustment Knob clockwise, as illustrated in Figure 6.

## Battery Shutoff
The Battery Shutoff Button (3) enables the operator to completely disconnect the battery and electrical power from the AAD.  
When the Battery Shutoff Button (3) is pressed, the battery is isolated from the device, ensuring no electrical power is supplied.  
If a USB-C power source is connected while the Battery Shutoff Button is pressed, the Power Indicator will display a green light with a red shadow, indicating that the battery is isolated.  
Normally, it is not necessary to test this function, as the user can visually confirm that the button has been pressed.  
If the Power Indicator flashes blue, red, or magenta while the Battery Shutoff Button is depressed, this means the power is on, but the battery is disconnected, and the device will not operate.  
If the Battery Shutoff Button cannot be pressed, it may indicate that battery replacement is required.

---

## Charging the AAD
Connect the USB-C input port (6) to a charger or suitable power source using a USB charging cable. The Battery Light will display red while charging and will turn green when the device is fully charged.
